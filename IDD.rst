 Interface Design Description
==============================


Scope
=====

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.


Identification
--------------

.. This paragraph shall contain a full identification of the
   system(s), the interfacing entities, and interfaces to which this
   document applies, including, as applicable, identification
   number(s), title(s), abbreviation(s), version number(s), and
   release number(s).


System overview
---------------

.. This paragraph shall briefly state the purpose of the system(s) and
   software to which this document applies. It shall describe the
   general nature of the system and software; summarize the history of
   system development, operation, and maintenance; identify the
   project sponsor, acquirer, user, developer, and support agencies;
   identify current and planned operating sites; and list other
   relevant documents.


Document overview
-----------------

.. This paragraph shall summarize the purpose and contents of this
   document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations
   associated with its use.


Referenced documents
====================

.. This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of
   all documents referenced in this document. This section shall also
   identify the source for all documents not available through normal
   Government stocking activities.


Interface design
================

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   describe the interface characteristics of one or more systems,
   subsystems, configuration items, manual operations, or other system
   components. If part or all of the design depends upon system states
   or modes, this dependency shall be indicated. If design information
   falls into more than one paragraph, it may be presented once and
   referenced from the other paragraphs. If part or all of this
   information is documented elsewhere, it may be referenced. Design
   conventions needed to understand the design shall be presented or
   referenced.


Interface identification and diagrams
-------------------------------------

.. For each interface identified in 1.1, this paragraph shall state
   the project-unique identifier assigned to the interface and shall
   identify the interfacing entities (systems, configuration items,
   users, etc.) by name, number, version, and documentation
   references, as applicable. The identification shall state which
   entities have fixed interface characteristics (and therefore impose
   interface requirements on interfacing entities) and which are being
   developed or modified (thus having interface requirements imposed
   on them). One or more interface diagrams shall be provided, as
   appropriate, to depict the interfaces.


(Project unique identifier of interface)
----------------------------------------

.. This paragraph (beginning with 3.2) shall identify an interface by
   project unique identifier, shall briefly identify the interfacing
   entities, and shall be divided into subparagraphs as needed to
   describe the interface characteristics of one or both of the
   interfacing entities. If a given interfacing entity is not covered
   by this IDD (for example, an external system) but its interface
   characteristics need to be mentioned to describe interfacing
   entities that are, these characteristics shall be stated as
   assumptions or as "When [the entity not covered] does this, [the
   entity that is covered] will ...." This paragraph may reference
   other documents (such as data dictionaries, standards for
   protocols, and standards for user interfaces) in place of stating
   the information here. The design description shall include the
   following, as applicable, presented in any order suited to the
   information to be provided, and shall note any differences in these
   characteristics from the point of view of the interfacing entities
   (such as different expectations about the size, frequency, or other
   characteristics of data elements):

.. Priority assigned to the interface by the interfacing entity(ies)
   Type of interface (such as real-time data transfer,
   storage-and-retrieval of data, etc.) to be implemented
   Characteristics of individual data elements that the interfacing
   entity(ies) will provide, store, send, access, receive, etc., such
   as:
   1.  Names/identifiers
       1.  Project-unique identifier
       2.  Non-technical (natural-language) name
       3.  DoD standard data element name
       4.  Technical name (e.g., variable or field name in code or
           database)
       5.  Abbreviation or synonymous names

.. 2.  Data type (alphanumeric, integer, etc.)
   3.  Size and format (such as length and punctuation of a character
       string)
   4.  Units of measurement (such as meters, dollars, nanoseconds)
   5.  Range or enumeration of possible values (such as 0-99)
   6.  Accuracy (how correct) and precision (number of significant
       digits)
   7.  Priority, timing, frequency, volume, sequencing, and other
       constraints, such as whether the data element may be updated and
       whether business rules apply
   8.  Security and privacy constraints
   9.  Sources (setting/sending entities) and recipients
       (using/receiving entities)

.. Characteristics of data element assemblies (records, messages,
   files, arrays, displays, reports, etc.) that the interfacing
   entity(ies) will provide, store, send, access, receive, etc., such
   as:
   1.  Names/identifiers
       1.  Project-unique identifier
       2.  Non-technical (natural language) name
       3.  Technical name (e.g., record or data structure name in code or
           database)
       4.  Abbreviations or synonymous names

.. 2.  Data elements in the assembly and their structure (number,
       order, grouping)
   3.  Medium (such as disk) and structure of data elements/assemblies
       on the medium
   4.  Visual and auditory characteristics of displays and other
       outputs (such as colors, layouts, fonts, icons and other display
       elements, beeps, lights)
   5.  Relationships among assemblies, such as sorting/access
       characteristics
   6.  Priority, timing, frequency, volume, sequencing, and other
       constraints, such as whether the assembly may be updated and
       whether business rules apply
   7.  Security and privacy constraints
   8.  Sources (setting/sending entities) and recipients
       (using/receiving entities)

   entity(ies) will use for the interface, such as:
   1.  Project-unique identifier(s)
   2.  Communication links/bands/frequencies/media and their
       characteristics
   3.  Message formatting

   plug compatibility, etc.)

Requirements traceability
=========================

.. This paragraph shall contain:

.. 1.  Traceability from each interfacing entity covered by this IDD
       to the system or CSCI requirements addressed by the entity's

   2.  Traceability from each system or CSCI requirement that affects
       an interface covered in this IDD to the interfacing entities that
       address it.
