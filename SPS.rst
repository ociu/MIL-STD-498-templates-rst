Scope
=====

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.


Identification
--------------

.. This paragraph shall contain a full identification of the system
   and the software to which this document applies, including, as
   applicable, identification number(s), title(s), abbreviation(s),
   version number(s), and release number(s).


System overview
---------------

.. This paragraph shall briefly state the purpose of the system and
   the software to which this document applies. It shall describe the
   general nature of the system and software; summarize the history of
   system development, operation, and maintenance; identify the
   project sponsor, acquirer, user, developer, and support agencies;
   identify current and planned operating sites; and list other
   relevant documents.


Document overview
-----------------

.. This paragraph shall summarize the purpose and contents of this
   document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations
   associated with its use.


Referenced documents
====================

.. This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of
   all documents referenced in this specification. This section shall
   also identify the source for all documents not available through
   normal Government stocking activities.


Requirements
============

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   achieve delivery of the software and to establish the requirements
   that another body of software must meet to be considered a valid
   copy of the CSCI.   
   Note: In past versions of this DID, Section 3 required a
   presentation of the software design describing the "as built"
   software. That approach was modeled on hardware development, in
   which the product specification presents the final design as the
   requirement to which hardware items must be manufactured. For
   software, however, this approach does not apply. Software
   "manufacturing" consists of electronic duplication of the software
   itself, not recreation from design, and the validity of a
   "manufactured" copy is determined by comparison to the software
   itself, not to a design description. This section therefore
   establishes the software itself as the criterion that must be
   matched for a body of software to be considered a valid copy of the
   CSCI. The updated software design has been placed in Section 5
   below, not as a requirement, but as information to be used to
   modify, enhance, or otherwise support the software. If any portion
   of this specification is placed under acquirer configuration
   control, it should be limited to Section 3. It is the software
   itself that establishes the product baseline, not a description of
   the software's design.


Executable software
-------------------

.. This paragraph shall provide, by reference to enclosed or otherwise
   provided electronic media, the executable software for the CSCI,
   including any batch files, command files, data files, or other
   software files needed to install and operate the software on its
   target computer(s). In order for a body of software to be
   considered a valid copy of the CSCI's executable software, it must
   be shown to match these files exactly.


Source files
------------

.. This paragraph shall provide, by reference to enclosed or otherwise
   provided electronic media, the source files for the CSCI, including
   any batch files, command files, data files, or other files needed
   to regenerate the executable software for the CSCI. In order for a
   body of software to be considered a valid copy of the CSCI's source
   files, it must be shown to match these files exactly.


Packaging requirements
----------------------

.. This paragraph shall state the requirements, if any, for packaging
   and marking copies of the CSCI.


Qualification provisions
========================

.. This paragraph shall state the method(s) to be used to demonstrate
   that a given body of software is a valid copy of the CSCI. For
   example, the method for executable files might be to establish that
   each executable file referenced in 3.1 has an identically-named
   counterpart in the software in question and that each such
   counterpart can be shown, via bit-for-bit comparison, check sum, or
   other method, to be identical to the corresponding executable file.
   The method for source files might be comparable, using the source
   files referenced in 3.2.


Software support information
============================

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   provide information needed to support the CSCI.


"As built" software design
--------------------------

.. This paragraph shall contain, or reference an appendix or other
   deliverable document that contains, information describing the
   design of the "as built" CSCI. The information shall be the same as
   that required in a Software Design Description (SDD), Interface
   Design Description (IDD), and Database Design Description (DBDD),
   as applicable. If these documents or their equivalents are to be
   delivered for the "as built" CSCI, this paragraph shall reference
   them. If not, the information shall be provided in this document.
   Information provided in the headers, comments, and code of the
   source code listings may be referenced and need not be repeated in
   this section. If the SDD, IDD, or DBDD is included in an appendix,
   the paragraph numbers and page numbers need not be changed.


Compilation/build procedures
----------------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe, or reference an appendix that
   describes, the compilation/build process to be used to create the
   executable files from the source files and to prepare the
   executable files to be loaded into firmware or other distribution
   media. It shall specify the compiler(s)/assembler(s) to be used,
   including version numbers; other hardware and software needed,
   including version numbers; any settings, options, or conventions to
   be used; and procedures for compiling/assembling, linking, and
   building the CSCI and the software system/subsystem containing the
   CSCI, including variations for different sites, configurations,
   versions, etc. Build procedures above the CSCI level may be
   presented in one SPS and referenced from the others.


Modification procedures
-----------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe procedures that must be followed to
   modify the CSCI. It shall include or reference information on the
   following, as applicable:

.. 1.  Support facilities, equipment, and software, and procedures for
       their use
   2.  Databases/data files used by the CSCI and procedures for using
       and modifying them
   3.  Design, coding, and other conventions to be followed
   4.  Compilation/build procedures if different from those above
   5.  Integration and testing procedures to be followed


Computer hardware resource utilization
--------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe the "as built" CSCI's measured
   utilization of computer hardware resources (such as processor
   capacity, memory capacity, input/output device capacity, auxiliary
   storage capacity, and communications/ network equipment capacity).
   It shall cover all computer hardware resources included in
   utilization requirements for the CSCI, in system-level resource
   allocations affecting the CSCI, or in the software development
   plan. If all utilization data for a given computer hardware
   resource is presented in a single location, such as in one SPS,
   this paragraph may reference that source. Included for each
   computer hardware resource shall be:

.. The CSCI requirements or system-level resource allocations being
   satisfied. (Alternatively, the traceability to CSCI requirements
   may be provided in 6.c.)
   The assumptions and conditions on which the utilization data are
   based (for example, typical usage, worst-case usage, assumption of
   certain events)
   Any special considerations affecting the utilization (such as use
   of virtual memory, overlays, or multiprocessors or the impacts of
   operating system overhead, library software, or other
   implementation overhead)
   The units of measure used (such as percentage of processor
   capacity, cycles per second, bytes of memory, kilobytes per second)
   The level(s) at which the estimates or measures have been made
   (such as software unit, CSCI, or executable program)

Requirements traceability
=========================

.. This section shall provide:

.. Traceability from each CSCI source file to the software unit(s)
   that it implements.
   Traceability from each software unit to the source files that
   implement it.
   Traceability from each computer hardware resource utilization
   measurement given in 5.4 to the CSCI requirements it addresses.
   (Alternatively, this traceability may be provided in 5.4.)
   Traceability from each CSCI requirement regarding computer hardware
   resource utilization to the utilization measurements given in 5.4.

Notes
=====

.. This section shall contain any general information that aids in
   understanding this specification (e.g., background information,
   glossary, rationale). This section shall include an alphabetical
   listing of all acronyms, abbreviations, and their meanings as used
   in this document and a list of any terms and definitions needed to
   understand this document.


Appendixes
==========

.. Appendixes may be used to provide information published separately
   for convenience in document maintenance (e.g., charts, classified
   data). As applicable, each appendix shall be referenced in the main
   body of the document where the data would normally have been
   provided. Appendixes may be bound as separate documents for ease in
   handling. Appendixes shall be lettered alphabetically (A, B,
   etc.).
