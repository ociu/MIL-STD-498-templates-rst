Scope
=====

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.


Identification
--------------

.. This paragraph shall contain a full identification of the systems,
   the interfacing entities, and the interfaces to which this document
   applies, including, as applicable, identification number(s),
   title(s), abbreviation(s), version number(s), and release
   number(s).


System overview
---------------

.. This paragraph shall briefly state the purpose of the system(s) and
   software to which this document applies. It shall describe the
   general nature of the system and software; summarize the history of
   system development, operation, and maintenance; identify the
   project sponsor, acquirer, user, developer, and support agencies;
   identify current and planned operating sites; and list other
   relevant documents.


Document overview
-----------------

.. This paragraph shall summarize the purpose and contents of this
   document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations
   associated with its use.


Referenced documents
====================

.. This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of
   all documents referenced in this specification. This section shall
   also identify the source for all documents not available through
   normal Government stocking activities.


Requirements
============

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   specify the requirements imposed on one or more systems,
   subsystems, configuration items, manual operations, or other system
   components to achieve one or more interfaces among these entities.
   Each requirement shall be assigned a project-unique identifier to
   support testing and traceability and shall be stated in such a way
   that an objective test can be defined for it. Each requirement
   shall be annotated with associated qualification method(s) (see
   section 4) and traceability to system (or subsystem, if applicable)
   requirements (see section 5.a) if not provided in those sections.
   The degree of detail to be provided shall be guided by the
   following rule: Include those characteristics of the interfacing
   entities that are conditions for their acceptance; defer to design
   descriptions those characteristics that the acquirer is willing to
   leave up to the developer. If a given requirement fits into more
   than one paragraph, it may be stated once and referenced from the
   other paragraphs. If an interfacing entity included in this
   specification will operate in states and/or modes having interface
   requirements different from other states and modes, each
   requirement or group of requirements for that entity shall be
   correlated to the states and modes. The correlation may be
   indicated by a table or other method in this paragraph, in an
   appendix referenced from this paragraph, or by annotation of the
   requirements in the paragraphs where they appear.


Interface identification and diagrams
-------------------------------------

.. For each interface identified in 1.1, this paragraph shall include
   a project-unique identifier and shall designate the interfacing
   entities (systems, configuration items, users, etc.) by name,
   number, version, and documentation references, as applicable. The
   identification shall state which entities have fixed interface
   characteristics (and therefore impose interface requirements on
   interfacing entities) and which are being developed or modified
   (thus having interface requirements imposed on them). One or more
   interface diagrams shall be provided to depict the interfaces.


(Project unique identifier of interface)
----------------------------------------

.. This paragraph (beginning with 3.2) shall identify an interface by
   project unique identifier, shall briefly identify the interfacing
   entities, and shall be divided into subparagraphs as needed to
   state the requirements imposed on one or more of the interfacing
   entities to achieve the interface. If the interface characteristics
   of an entity are not covered by this IRS but need to be mentioned
   to specify the requirements for entities that are, those
   characteristics shall be stated as assumptions or as "When [the
   entity not covered] does this, the [entity being specified]
   shall...," rather than as requirements on the entities not covered
   by this IRS. This paragraph may reference other documents (such as
   data dictionaries, standards for communication protocols, and
   standards for user interfaces) in place of stating the information
   here. The requirements shall include the following, as applicable,
   presented in any order suited to the requirements, and shall note
   any differences in these characteristics from the point of view of
   the interfacing entities (such as different expectations about the
   size, frequency, or other characteristics of data elements):

.. Priority that the interfacing entity(ies) must assign the interface
   Requirements on the type of interface (such as real-time data
   transfer, storage-and-retrieval of data, etc.) to be implemented
   Required characteristics of individual data elements that the
   interfacing entity(ies) must provide, store, send, access, receive,
   etc., such as:
   1.  Names/identifiers
       1.  Project-unique identifier
       2.  Non-technical (natural-language) name
       3.  DoD standard data element name
       4.  Technical name (e.g., variable or field name in code or
           database)
       5.  Abbreviation or synonymous names

   3.  Size and format (such as length and punctuation of a character
       string)
   4.  Units of measurement (such as meters, dollars, nanoseconds)
   5.  Range or enumeration of possible values (such as 0-99)
   6.  Accuracy (how correct) and precision (number of significant
       digits)
   7.  Priority, timing, frequency, volume, sequencing, and other
       constraints, such as whether the data element may be updated and
       whether business rules apply
   8.  Security and privacy constraints
   9.  Sources (setting/sending entities) and recipients
       (using/receiving entities)

.. Required characteristics of data element assemblies (records,
   messages, files, arrays, displays, reports, etc.) that the
   interfacing entity(ies) must provide, store, send, access, receive,
   etc., such as:
   1.  Names/identifiers
       1.  Project-unique identifier
       2.  Non-technical (natural language) name
       3.  Technical name (e.g., record or data structure name in code or
           database)
       4.  Abbreviations or synonymous names

.. 2.  Data elements in the assembly and their structure (number,
       order, grouping)
   3.  Medium (such as disk) and structure of data elements/assemblies
       on the medium
   4.  Visual and auditory characteristics of displays and other
       outputs (such as colors, layouts, fonts, icons and other display
       elements, beeps, lights)
   5.  Relationships among assemblies, such as sorting/access
       characteristics
   6.  Priority, timing, frequency, volume, sequencing, and other
       constraints, such as whether the assembly may be updated and
       whether business rules apply
   7.  Security and privacy constraints
   8.  Sources (setting/sending entities) and recipients
       (using/receiving entities)

.. Required characteristics of communication methods that the
   interfacing entity(ies) must use for the interface, such as:
   1.  Project-unique identifier(s)
   2.  Communication links/bands/frequencies/media and their
       characteristics
   3.  Message formatting
   4.  Flow control (such as sequence numbering and buffer allocation)
   5.  Data transfer rate, whether periodic/aperiodic, and interval
       between transfers
   6.  Routing, addressing, and naming conventions
   7.  Transmission services, including priority and grade

.. Other required characteristics, such as physical compatibility of
   the interfacing entities (dimensions, tolerances, loads, plug
   compatibility, etc.), voltages, etc.

Precedence and criticality of requirements
------------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall be numbered as the last paragraph in Section 3
   and shall specify, if applicable, the order of precedence,
   criticality, or assigned weights indicating the relative importance
   of the requirements in this specification. Examples include
   identifying those requirements deemed critical to safety, to
   security, or to privacy for purposes of singling them out for
   special treatment. If all requirements have equal weight, this
   paragraph shall so state.


Qualification provisions
========================

.. This section shall define a set of qualification methods and shall
   specify, for each requirement in Section 3, the qualification
   method(s) to be used to ensure that the requirement has been met. A
   table may be used to present this information, or each requirement
   in Section 3 may be annotated with the method(s) to be used.
   Qualification methods may include:

.. Demonstration: The operation of interfacing entities that relies on
   observable functional operation not requiring the use of
   instrumentation, special test equipment, or subsequent analysis.
   Test: The operation of interfacing entities using instrumentation
   or special test equipment to collect data for later analysis.
   Analysis: The processing of accumulated data obtained from other
   qualification methods. Examples are reduction, interpretation, or
   extrapolation of test results.
   Inspection: The visual examination of interfacing entities,
   documentation, etc.
   Special qualification methods: Any special qualification methods
   for the interfacing entities, such as special tools, techniques,
   procedures, facilities, and acceptance limits.
   # 5. Requirements traceability

.. For system-level interfacing entities, this paragraph does not
   apply. For each subsystem- or lower-level interfacing entity
   covered by this IRS, this paragraph shall contain:

.. Traceability from each requirement imposed on the entity in this
   specification to the system (or subsystem, if applicable)
   requirements it addresses. (Alternatively, this traceability may be
   provided by annotating each requirement in Section 3.)   
   Note: Each level of system refinement may result in requirements
   not directly traceable to higher-level requirements. For example, a
   system architectural design that creates multiple CSCIs may result
   in requirements about how the CSCIs will interface, even though
   these interfaces are not covered in system requirements. Such
   requirements may be traced to a general requirement such as "system
   implementation" or to the system design decisions that resulted in
   their generation.
   Traceability from each system (or subsystem, if applicable)
   requirement that has been allocated to the interfacing entity and
   that affects an interface covered in this specification to the
   requirements in this specification that address it.
