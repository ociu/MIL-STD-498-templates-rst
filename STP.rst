Orientation plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall describe any orientation and training to be
   given before and during the testing. This information shall be
   related to the personnel needs given in 3.x.7. This training may
   include user instruction, operator instruction, maintenance and
