++++++++++++++++++++++

.. This paragraph shall identify the CSCI or system requirements
   addressed by the test case. (Alternatively, this information may be
   provided in 5.a.)


Prerequisite conditions
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. This paragraph shall identify any prerequisite conditions that must
   be established prior to performing the test case. The following
   considerations shall be discussed, as applicable:

.. 1.  Hardware and software configuration
   2.  Flags, initial breakpoints, pointers, control parameters, or

.. 1.  Name, purpose, and description (e.g., range of values,
       accuracy) of each test input
   2.  Source of the test input and the method to be used for
       selecting the test input

   4.  Time or event sequence of test input
   5.  The manner in which the input data will be controlled to:
       1.  Test the item(s) with a minimum/reasonable number of data types
           and values
       2.  Exercise the item(s) with a range of valid data types and
           values that test for overload, saturation, and other "worst case"
           effects
       3.  Exercise the item(s) with invalid data types and values to test
           for appropriate handling of irregular inputs
       4.  Permit retesting, if necessary



Expected test results
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. This paragraph shall identify all expected test results for the
   test case. Both intermediate and final test results shall be
   provided, as applicable.


Criteria for evaluating results
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. This paragraph shall identify the criteria to be used for
   evaluating the intermediate and final results of the test case. For
   each test result, the following information shall be provided, as
   applicable:

.. 1.  The range or accuracy over which an output can vary and still
       be acceptable
   2.  Minimum number of combinations or alternatives of input and
       output conditions that constitute an acceptable test result
   3.  Maximum/minimum allowable test duration, in terms of time or
       number of events
   4.  Maximum number of interrupts, halts, or other system breaks
       that may occur
   5.  Allowable severity of processing errors
   6.  Conditions under which the result is inconclusive and re
       testing is to be performed
   7.  Conditions under which the outputs are to be interpreted as
       indicating irregularities in input test data, in the test
       database/data files, or in test procedures
   8.  Allowable indications of the control, status, and results of
       the test and the readiness for the next test case (may be output of
       auxiliary test software)
   9.  Additional criteria not mentioned above.


Test procedure
++++++++++++++

.. This paragraph shall define the test procedure for the test case.
   The test procedure shall be defined as a series of individually
   numbered steps listed sequentially in the order in which the steps
   are to be performed. For convenience in document maintenance, the
   test procedures may be included as an appendix and referenced in
   this paragraph. The appropriate level of detail in each test
   procedure depends on the type of software being tested. For some
   software, each keystroke may be a separate test procedure step; for
   most software, each step may include a logically related series of
   keystrokes or other actions. The appropriate level of detail is the
   level at which it is useful to specify expected results and compare
   them to actual results. The following shall be provided for each
   test procedure, as applicable:

.. Test operator actions and equipment operation required for each
   step, including commands, as applicable, to:
   1.  Initiate the test case and apply test inputs
   2.  Inspect test conditions
   3.  Perform interim evaluations of test results
   4.  Record data
   5.  Halt or interrupt the test case
   6.  Request data dumps or other aids, if needed
   7.  Modify the database/data files
   8.  Repeat the test case if unsuccessful
   9.  Apply alternate modes as required by the test case
   10. Terminate the test case

.. Expected result and evaluation criteria for each step
   If the test case addresses multiple requirements, identification of
   which test procedure step(s) address which requirements.
   (Alternatively, this information may be provided in 5.)
   Actions to follow in the event of a program stop or indicated
   error, such as:
   1.  Recording of critical data from indicators for reference
       purposes
   2.  Halting or pausing time sensitive test support software and
       test apparatus
   3.  Collection of system and operator records of test results

.. Procedures to be used to reduce and analyze test results to
   accomplish the following, as applicable:
   1.  Detect whether an output has been produced
   2.  Identify media and location of data produced by the test case
   3.  Evaluate output as a basis for continuation of test sequence
   4.  Evaluate test output against required output


Assumptions and constraints
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. This paragraph shall identify any assumptions made and constraints
   or limitations imposed in the description of the test case due to
   system or test conditions, such as limitations on timing,
   interfaces, equipment, personnel, and database/data files. If
   waivers or exceptions to specified limits and parameters are
   approved, they shall be identified and this paragraph shall address
   their effects and impacts upon the test case.


Requirements traceability
=========================

.. This paragraph shall contain:

.. 1.  Traceability from each test case in this STD to the system or
       CSCI requirements it addresses. If a test case addresses multiple
       requirements, traceability from each set of test procedure steps to
       the requirement(s) addressed. (Alternatively, this traceability may
       be provided in 4.x.y.1.)
   2.  Traceability from each system or CSCI requirement covered by
       this STD to the test case(s) that address it. For CSCI testing,
       traceability from each CSCI requirement in the CSCI's Software
       Requirements Specification (SRS) and associated Interface
       Requirements Specifications (IRSs). For system testing,
       traceability from each system requirement in the system's
       System/Subsystem Specification (SSS) and associated IRSs. If a test
       case addresses multiple requirements, the traceability shall
       indicate the particular test procedure steps that address each
       requirement.

   data). As applicable, each appendix shall be referenced in the main
   body of the document where the data would normally have been
   provided. Appendixes may be bound as separate documents for ease in
