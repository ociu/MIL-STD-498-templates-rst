Scope
=====

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.


Identification
--------------

.. This paragraph shall contain a full identification of the system
   and the software to which this document applies, including, as
   applicable, identification number(s), title(s), abbreviation(s),
   version number(s), and release number(s).


System overview
---------------

.. This paragraph shall briefly state the purpose of the system and
   the software to which this document applies. It shall describe the
   general nature of the system and software; summarize the history of
   system development, operation, and maintenance; identify the
   project sponsor, acquirer, user, developer, and support agencies;
   identify current and planned operating sites; and list other
   relevant documents.


Document overview
-----------------

.. This paragraph shall summarize the purpose and contents of this
   document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations
   associated with its use.


Referenced documents
====================

.. This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of
   all documents referenced in this specification. This section shall
   also identify the source for all documents not available through
   normal Government stocking activities.


Requirements
============

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   specify the CSCI requirements, that is, those characteristics of
   the CSCI that are conditions for its acceptance. CSCI requirements
   are software requirements generated to satisfy the system
   requirements allocated to this CSCI. Each requirement shall be
   assigned a project-unique identifier to support testing and
   traceability and shall be stated in such a way that an objective
   test can be defined for it. Each requirement shall be annotated
   with associated qualification method(s) (see section 4) and
   traceability to system (or subsystem, if applicable) requirements
   (see section 5.a) if not provided in those sections. The degree of
   detail to be provided shall be guided by the following rule:
   Include those characteristics of the CSCI that are conditions for
   CSCI acceptance; defer to design descriptions those characteristics
   that the acquirer is willing to leave up to the developer. If there
   are no requirements in a given paragraph, the paragraph shall so
   state. If a given requirement fits into more than one paragraph, it
   may be stated once and referenced from the other paragraphs.


Required states and modes
-------------------------

.. If the CSCI is required to operate in more than one state or mode
   having requirements distinct from other states or modes, this
   paragraph shall identify and define each state and mode. Examples
   of states and modes include: idle, ready, active, post-use
   analysis, training, degraded, emergency, backup, wartime,
   peacetime. The distinction between states and modes is arbitrary. A
   CSCI may be described in terms of states only, modes only, states
   within modes, modes within states, or any other scheme that is
   useful. If no states or modes are required, this paragraph shall so
   state, without the need to create artificial distinctions. If
   states and/or modes are required, each requirement or group of
   requirements in this specification shall be correlated to the
   states and modes. The correlation may be indicated by a table or
   other method in this paragraph, in an appendix referenced from this
   paragraph, or by annotation of the requirements in the paragraphs
   where they appear.


CSCI capability requirements
----------------------------

.. This paragraph shall be divided into subparagraphs to itemize the
   requirements associated with each capability of the CSCI. A
   "capability" is defined as a group of related requirements. The
   word "capability" may be replaced with "function," "subject,"
   "object," or other term useful for presenting the requirements.


(CSCI capability)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall identify a required CSCI capability and shall
   itemize the requirements associated with the capability. If the
   capability can be more clearly specified by dividing it into
   constituent capabilities, the constituent capabilities shall be
   specified in subparagraphs. The requirements shall specify required
   behavior of the CSCI and shall include applicable parameters, such
   as response times, throughput times, other timing constraints,
   sequencing, accuracy, capacities (how much/how many), priorities,
   continuous operation requirements, and allowable deviations based
   on operating conditions. The requirements shall include, as
   applicable, required behavior under unexpected, unallowed, or "out
   of bounds" conditions, requirements for error handling, and any
   provisions to be incorporated into the CSCI to provide continuity
   of operations in the event of emergencies. Paragraph 3.3.x of this
   DID provides a list of topics to be considered when specifying
   requirements regarding inputs the CSCI must accept and outputs it
   must produce.


CSCI external interface requirements
------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall be divided into subparagraphs to specify the
   requirements, if any, for the CSCI's external interfaces. This
   paragraph may reference one or more Interface Requirements
   Specifications (IRSs) or other documents containing these
   requirements.


Interface identification and diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall identify the required external interfaces of
   the CSCI (that is, relationships with other entities that involve
   sharing, providing or exchanging data). The identification of each
   interface shall include a project-unique identifier and shall
   designate the interfacing entities (systems, configuration items,
   users, etc.) by name, number, version, and documentation
   references, as applicable. The identification shall state which
   entities have fixed interface characteristics (and therefore impose
   interface requirements on interfacing entities) and which are being
   developed or modified (thus having interface requirements imposed
   on them). One or more interface diagrams shall be provided to
   depict the interfaces.


(Project unique identifier of interface)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph (beginning with 3.3.2) shall identify a CSCI
   external interface by project unique identifier, shall briefly
   identify the interfacing entities, and shall be divided into
   subparagraphs as needed to state the requirements imposed on the
   CSCI to achieve the interface. Interface characteristics of the
   other entities involved in the interface shall be stated as
   assumptions or as "When [the entity not covered] does this, the
   CSCI shall...," not as requirements on the other entities. This
   paragraph may reference other documents (such as data dictionaries,
   standards for communication protocols, and standards for user
   interfaces) in place of stating the information here. The
   requirements shall include the following, as applicable, presented
   in any order suited to the requirements, and shall note any
   differences in these characteristics from the point of view of the
   interfacing entities (such as different expectations about the
   size, frequency, or other characteristics of data elements):

   on 8 track magnetic tape labelled and packaged in a certain way).
   Applicable military specifications and standards may be referenced
   if appropriate.


Precedence and criticality of requirements
------------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall specify, if applicable, the order of
   precedence, criticality, or assigned weights indicating the
   relative importance of the requirements in this specification.
   Examples include identifying those requirements deemed critical to
   safety, to security, or to privacy for purposes of singling them
   out for special treatment. If all requirements have equal weight,
   this paragraph shall so state.


Qualification provisions
========================

.. This section shall define a set of qualification methods and shall
   specify for each requirement in Section 3 the method(s) to be used
   to ensure that the requirement has been met. A table may be used to
   present this information, or each requirement in Section 3 may be
   annotated with the method(s) to be used. Qualification methods may
   include:

.. Demonstration: The operation of the CSCI, or a part of the CSCI,
   that relies on observable functional operation not requiring the
   use of instrumentation, special test equipment, or subsequent
   analysis.
   Test: The operation of the CSCI, or a part of the CSCI, using
   instrumentation or other special test equipment to collect data for
   later analysis.
   Analysis: The processing of accumulated data obtained from other
   qualification methods. Examples are reduction, interpretation, or
   extrapolation of test results.
   Inspection: The visual examination of CSCI code, documentation,
   etc.
   Special qualification methods: Any special qualification methods
   for the CSCI, such as special tools, techniques, procedures,
   facilities, and acceptance limits.

Requirements traceability
=========================

.. This paragraph shall contain:

.. Traceability from each CSCI requirement in this specification to
   the system (or subsystem, if applicable) requirements it addresses.
   (Alternatively, this traceability may be provided by annotating
   each requirement in Section 3.)   
   Note: Each level of system refinement may result in requirements
   not directly traceable to higher-level requirements. For example, a
   system architectural design that creates multiple CSCIs may result
   in requirements about how the CSCIs will interface, even though
   these interfaces are not covered in system requirements. Such
   requirements may be traced to a general requirement such as "system
   implementation" or to the system design decisions that resulted in
   their generation.
   Traceability from each system (or subsystem, if applicable)
   requirement allocated to this CSCI to the CSCI requirements that
   address it. All system (subsystem) requirements allocated to this
   CSCI shall be accounted for. Those that trace to CSCI requirements
   contained in IRSs shall reference those IRSs.

Notes
=====

.. This section shall contain any general information that aids in
   understanding this specification (e.g., background information,
   glossary, rationale). This section shall include an alphabetical
   listing of all acronyms, abbreviations, and their meanings as used
   in this document and a list of any terms and definitions needed to
   understand this document.


Appendixes
==========

.. Appendixes may be used to provide information published separately
   for convenience in document maintenance (e.g., charts, classified
   data). As applicable, each appendix shall be referenced in the main
   body of the document where the data would normally have been
   provided. Appendixes may be bound as separate documents for ease in
   handling. Appendixes shall be lettered alphabetically (A, B,
   etc.).
