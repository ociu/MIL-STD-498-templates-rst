   general nature of the system and software; summarize the history of
   system development, operation, and maintenance; identify the
   project sponsor, acquirer, user, developer, and support agencies;
   identify current and planned operating sites; and list other
   relevant documents.

.. This paragraph shall summarize the purpose and contents of this
   document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations
   associated with its use.

.. # 




Referenced documents
====================

.. This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of
   all documents referenced in this document. This section shall also
   identify the source for all documents not available through normal
   Government stocking activities.


CSCI-wide design decisions
==========================

.. This section shall be divided into paragraphs as needed to present
   CSCI-wide design decisions, that is, decisions about the CSCI's
   behavioral design (how it will behave, from a user's point of view,
   in meeting its requirements, ignoring internal implementation) and
   other decisions affecting the selection and design of the software
   units that make up the CSCI. If all such decisions are explicit in
   the CSCI requirements or are deferred to the design of the CSCI's
   software units, this section shall so state. Design decisions that
   respond to requirements designated critical, such as those for
   safety, security, or privacy, shall be placed in separate
   subparagraphs. If a design decision depends upon system states or
   modes, this dependency shall be indicated. Design conventions
   needed to understand the design shall be presented or referenced.
   Examples of CSCI-wide design decisions are the following:

.. Design decisions regarding inputs the CSCI will accept and outputs
   it will produce, including interfaces with other systems, HWCIs,
   CSCIs, and users (4.3.x of this DID identifies topics to be
   considered in this description). If part or all of this information
   is given in Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs), they may be
   referenced.
   Design decisions on CSCI behavior in response to each input or
   condition, including actions the CSCI will perform, response times
   and other performance characteristics, description of physical
   systems modeled, selected equations/algorithms/rules, and handling
   of unallowed inputs or conditions.
   Design decisions on how databases/data files will appear to the
   user (4.3.x of this DID identifies topics to be considered in this
   description). If part or all of this information is given in
   Database Design Descriptions (DBDDs), they may be referenced.
   Selected approach to meeting safety, security, and privacy
   requirements.
   Other CSCI-wide design decisions made in response to requirements,
   such as selected approach to providing required flexibility,
   availability, and maintainability.

CSCI architectural design
=========================

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   describe the CSCI architectural design. If part or all of the
   design depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall
   be indicated. If design information falls into more than one
   paragraph, it may be presented once and referenced from the other
   paragraphs. Design conventions needed to understand the design
   shall be presented or referenced.


CSCI components
---------------

.. This paragraph shall:

.. Identify the software units that make up the CSCI. Each software
   unit shall be assigned a project-unique identifier.   
   Note: A software unit is an element in the design of a CSCI; for
   example, a major subdivision of a CSCI, a component of that
   subdivision, a class, object, module, function, routine, or
   database. Software units may occur at different levels of a
   hierarchy and may consist of other software units. Software units
   in the design may or may not have a one-to-one relationship with
   the code and data entities (routines, procedures, databases, data
   files, etc.) that implement them or with the computer files
   containing those entities. A database may be treated as a CSCI or
   as a software unit. The SDD may refer to software units by any
   name(s) consistent with the design methodology being used.
   Show the static (such as "consists of") relationship(s) of the
   software units. Multiple relationships may be presented, depending
   on the selected software design methodology (for example, in an
   object-oriented design, this paragraph may present the class and
   object structures as well as the module and process architectures
   of the CSCI).
   State the purpose of each software unit and identify the CSCI
   requirements and CSCI-wide design decisions allocated to it.
   (Alternatively, the allocation of requirements may be provided in
   6.a.)
   Identify each software unit's development status/type (such as new
   development, existing design or software to be reused as is,
   existing design or software to be reengineered, software to be
   developed for reuse, software planned for Build N, etc.) For
   existing design or software, the description shall provide
   identifying information, such as name, version, documentation
   references, library, etc.
   Describe the CSCI's (and as applicable, each software unit's)
   planned utilization of computer hardware resources (such as
   processor capacity, memory capacity, input/output device capacity,
   auxiliary storage capacity, and communications/network equipment
   capacity). The description shall cover all computer hardware
   resources included in resource utilization requirements for the
   CSCI, in system-level resource allocations affecting the CSCI, and
   in resource utilization measurement planning in the Software
   Development Plan. If all utilization data for a given computer
   hardware resource are presented in a single location, such as in
   one SDD, this paragraph may reference that source. Included for
   each computer hardware resource shall be:
   1.  The CSCI requirements or system-level resource allocations
       being satisfied
   2.  The assumptions and conditions on which the utilization data
       are based (for example, typical usage, worst-case usage, assumption
       of certain events)
   3.  Any special considerations affecting the utilization (such as
       use of virtual memory, overlays, or multiprocessors or the impacts
       of operating system overhead, library software, or other
       implementation overhead)
   4.  The units of measure used (such as percentage of processor
       capacity, cycles per second, bytes of memory, kilobytes per second)
   5.  The level(s) at which the estimates or measures will be made
       (such as software unit, CSCI, or executable program)

.. Identify the program library in which the software that implements
   each software unit is to be placed

Concept of execution
--------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe the concept of execution among the
   software units. It shall include diagrams and descriptions showing
   the dynamic relationship of the software units, that is, how they
   will interact during CSCI operation, including, as applicable, flow
   of execution control, data flow, dynamically controlled sequencing,
   state transition diagrams, timing diagrams, priorities among units,
   handling of interrupts, timing/sequencing relationships, exception
   handling, concurrent execution, dynamic allocation/deallocation,
   dynamic creation/deletion of objects, processes, tasks, and other
   aspects of dynamic behavior.


Interface design
----------------

.. This paragraph shall be divided into the following subparagraphs to
   describe the interface characteristics of the software units. It
   shall include both interfaces among the software units and their
   interfaces with external entities such as systems, configuration
   items, and users. If part or all of this information is contained
   in Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs), in section 5 of the SDD,
   or elsewhere, these sources may be referenced.


Interface identification and diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall state the project-unique identifier assigned
   to each interface and shall identify the interfacing entities
   (software units, systems, configuration items, users, etc.) by
   name, number, version, and documentation references, as applicable.
   The identification shall state which entities have fixed interface
   characteristics (and therefore impose interface requirements on
   interfacing entities) and which are being developed or modified
   (thus having interface requirements imposed on them). One or more
   interface diagrams shall be provided, as appropriate, to depict the
   interfaces.


(Project unique identifier of interface)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph (beginning with 4.3.2) shall identify an interface
   by project unique identifier, shall briefly identify the
   interfacing entities, and shall be divided into subparagraphs as
   needed to describe the interface characteristics of one or both of
   the interfacing entities. If a given interfacing entity is not
   covered by this SDD (for example, an external system) but its
   interface characteristics need to be mentioned to describe
   interfacing entities that are, these characteristics shall be
   stated as assumptions or as "When [the entity not covered] does
   this, [the entity that is covered] will . . . ." This paragraph may
   reference other documents (such as data dictionaries, standards for
   protocols, and standards for user interfaces) in place of stating
   the information here. The design description shall include the
   following, as applicable, presented in any order suited to the
   information to be provided, and shall note any differences in these
   characteristics from the point of view of the interfacing entities
   (such as different expectations about the size, frequency, or other
   characteristics of data elements):

   paragraph, it may be presented once and referenced from the other
   paragraphs. Design conventions needed to understand the design
   shall be presented or referenced. Interface characteristics of
   software units may be described here, in Section 4, or in Interface
   Design Descriptions (IDDs). Software units that are databases, or
   that are used to access or manipulate databases, may be described
   here or in Database Design Descriptions (DBDDs).


(Project-unique identifier of a software unit, or designator of a group of software units)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall identify a software unit by project-unique
   identifier and shall describe the unit. The description shall
   include the following information, as applicable. Alternatively,
   this paragraph may designate a group of software units and identify
   and describe the software units in subparagraphs. Software units
   that contain other software units may reference the descriptions of
   those units rather than repeating information.

.. Unit design decisions, if any, such as algorithms to be used, if
   not previously selected
   Any constraints, limitations, or unusual features in the design of
   the software unit
   The programming language to be used and rationale for its use if
   other than the specified CSCI language
   If the software unit consists of or contains procedural commands
   (such as menu selections in a database management system (DBMS) for
   defining forms and reports, on-line DBMS queries for database
   access and manipulation, input to a graphical user interface (GUI)
   builder for automated code generation, commands to the operating
   system, or shell scripts), a list of the procedural commands and
   reference to user manuals or other documents that explain them
   If the software unit contains, receives, or outputs data, a
   description of its inputs, outputs, and other data elements and
   data element assemblies, as applicable. Paragraph 4.3.x of this DID
   provides a list of topics to be covered, as applicable. Data local
   to the software unit shall be described separately from data input
   to or output from the software unit. If the software unit is a
   database, a corresponding Database Design Description (DBDD) shall
   be referenced; interface characteristics may be provided here or by
   referencing section 4 or the corresponding Interface Design
   Description(s).
