Processing reference guide
==========================

.. This section shall provide the user with procedures for using the
   software. If procedures are complicated or extensive, additional
   Sections 6, 7, ... may be added in the same paragraph structure as
   this section and with titles meaningful to the sections selected.
   The organization of the document will depend on the characteristics
   of the software being documented. For example, one approach is to
   base the sections on the organizations in which users work, their
   assigned positions, their work sites, or the tasks they must
   perform. For other software, it may be more appropriate to have
   Section 5 be a guide to menus, Section 6 be a guide to the command
   language used, and Section 7 be a guide to functions. Detailed
   procedures are intended to be presented in subparagraphs of
   paragraph 5.3. Depending on the design of the software, the
   subparagraphs might be organized on a function by function, menu by
   menu, transaction-by-transaction, or other basis. Safety
   precautions, marked by WARNING or CAUTION, shall be included where
   applicable.


Capabilities
------------

.. This paragraph shall briefly describe the interrelationships of the
   transactions, menus, functions, or other processes in order to
   provide an overview of the use of the software.


Conventions
-----------

.. This paragraph shall describe any conventions used by the software,
   such as the use of colors in displays, the use of audible alarms,
   the use of abbreviated vocabulary, and the use of rules for
   assigning names or codes.


Processing procedures
---------------------

.. This paragraph shall explain the organization of subsequent
   paragraphs, e.g., by function, by menu, by screen. Any necessary
   order in which procedures must be accomplished shall be described.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. The title of this paragraph shall identify the function, menu,
   transaction, or other process being described. This paragraph shall
   describe and give options and examples, as applicable, of menus,
   graphical icons, data entry forms, user inputs, inputs from other
   software or hardware that may affect the software's interface with
   the user, outputs, diagnostic or error messages or alarms, and help
   facilities that can provide on-line descriptive or tutorial
   information. The format for presenting this information can be
   adapted to the particular characteristics of the software, but a
   consistent style of presentation shall be used, i.e., the
   descriptions of menus shall be consistent, the descriptions of
   transactions shall be consistent among themselves.


Related processing
------------------

.. This paragraph shall identify and describe any related batch,
   offline, or background processing performed by the software that is
   not invoked directly by the user and is not described in paragraph
   5.3. Any user responsibilities to support this processing shall be
   specified.

   backup data that can be used to replace primary copies of data in
   event of errors, defects, malfunctions, or accidents.

   can occur while accomplishing any of the user's functions. The
   meaning of each message and the action that should be taken after
   each such message shall be identified and described.


Quick-reference guide
---------------------

.. If appropriate to the software, this paragraph shall provide or
   reference a quick-reference card or page for using the software.
   This quick-reference guide shall summarize, as applicable,

   glossary, rationale). This section shall include an alphabetical
   listing of all acronyms, abbreviations, and their meanings as used
   in this document and a list of terms and definitions needed to
   understand this document. If section 5 has been expanded into
   section(s) 6, . . ., this section shall be numbered as the next
   section following section n.


Appendixes
==========

.. Appendixes may be used to provide information published separately
   for convenience in document maintenance (e.g., charts, classified
   data). As applicable, each appendix shall be referenced in the main
