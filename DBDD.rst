.. This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of
   all documents referenced in this manual. This section shall also
   identify the source for all documents not available through normal
   Government stocking activities.


Database-wide design decisions
==============================

.. This section shall be divided into paragraphs as needed to present
   database-wide design decisions, that is, decisions about the
   database's behavioral design (how it will behave, from a user's
   point of view, in meeting its requirements, ignoring internal
   implementation) and other decisions affecting further design of the
   database. If all such decisions are explicit in the system or CSCI
   requirements, this section shall so state. Design decisions that
   respond to requirements designated critical, such as those for
   safety, security, or privacy, shall be placed in separate
   subparagraphs. If a design decision depends upon system states or
   modes, this dependency shall be indicated. If some or all of the
   design decisions are described in the documentation of a custom or
   commercial database management system (DBMS), they may be
   referenced from this section. Design conventions needed to
   understand the design shall be presented or referenced. Examples of
   database-wide design decisions are the following:

.. Design decisions regarding queries or other inputs the database
   will accept and outputs (displays, reports, messages, responses,
   etc.) it will produce, including interfaces with other systems,
   HWCIs, CSCIs, and users (5.x.d of this DID identifies topics to be
   considered in this description). If part or all of this information
   is given in Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs), they may be
   referenced.
   Design decisions on database behavior in response to each input or
   query, including actions, response times and other performance
   characteristics, selected equations/algorithms/rules, disposition,
   and handling of unallowed inputs
   Design decisions on how databases/data files will appear to the
   user (4.x of this DID identifies topics to be considered in this
   description)
   Design decisions on the database management system to be used
   (including name, version/release) and the type of flexibility to be
   built into the database for adapting to changing requirements
   Design decisions on the levels and types of availability, security,
   privacy, and continuity of operations to be offered by the database
   Design decisions on database distribution (such as client/server),
   master database file updates and maintenance, including maintaining
   consistency, establishing/ reestablishing and maintaining
   synchronization, enforcing integrity and business rules
   Design decisions on backup and restoration including data and
   process distribution strategies, permissible actions during backup
   and restoration, and special considerations for new or non-standard
   technologies such as video and sound
   Design decisions on repacking, sorting, indexing, synchronization,
   and consistency including automated disk management and space
   reclamation considerations, optimizing strategies and
   considerations, storage and size considerations, and population of
   the database and capture of legacy data

Detailed design of the database
===============================

.. This section shall be divided into paragraphs as needed to describe
   the detailed design of the database. The number of levels of design
   and the names of those levels shall be based on the design
   methodology used. Examples of database design levels include
   conceptual, internal, logical, and physical. If part or all of the
   design depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall
   be indicated. Design conventions needed to understand the design
   shall be presented or referenced.   
   Note: This DID uses the term "data element assembly" to mean any
   entity, relation, schema, field, table, array, etc., that has
   structure (number/order/grouping of data elements) at a given
   design level (e.g., conceptual, internal, logical, physical) and
   the term "data element" to mean any relation, attribute, field,
   cell, data element, etc. that does not have structure at that
   level.

-------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall identify a database design level and shall
   describe the data elements and data element assemblies of the
   database in the terminology of the selected design method. The
   information shall include the following, as applicable, presented

   manipulation. If part or all of this information is provided
   elsewhere, such as in a Software Design Description (SDD), the SDD
   for a customized DBMS, or the user manual of a commercial DBMS,
   that information may be referenced rather than repeated here. If
   part or all of the design depends upon system states or modes, this
   dependency shall be indicated. If design information falls into
   more than one paragraph, it may be presented once and referenced
   from the other paragraphs. Design conventions needed to understand
   the design shall be presented or referenced.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall identify a software unit by project-unique
   identifier and shall describe the unit. The description shall
   include the following information, as applicable. Alternatively,
   this paragraph may designate a group of software units and identify
   and describe the software units in subparagraphs. Software units
   that contain other software units may reference the descriptions of
   those units rather than repeating information.

.. Unit design decisions, if any, such as algorithms to be used, if
   not previously selected
   Any constraints, limitations, or unusual features in the design of
   the software unit

   access and manipulation, input to a graphical user interface (GUI)
   builder for automated code generation, commands to the operating
   system, or shell scripts), a list of the procedural commands and a
   reference to user manuals or other documents that explain them
   If the software unit contains, receives, or outputs data, a
   description of its inputs, outputs, and other data elements and
   data element assemblies, as applicable. Data local to the software
   unit shall be described separately from data input to or output
   from the software unit. Interface characteristics may be provided
   here or by referencing Interface Design Description(s). If a given
   interfacing entity is not covered by this DBDD (for example, an
   external system) but its interface characteristics need to be
   mentioned to describe software units that are, these
   characteristics shall be stated as assumptions or as "When [the
   entity not covered] does this, [the software unit] will...." This
   paragraph may reference other documents (such as data dictionaries,
   standards for protocols, and standards for user interfaces) in
   place of stating the information here. The design description shall
   include the following, as applicable, presented in any order suited
   to the information to be provided, and shall note any differences
