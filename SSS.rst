 System/Subsystem Specification
================================


Scope
=====

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.


Identification
--------------

.. This paragraph shall contain a full identification of the system to
   which this document applies, including, as applicable,
   identification number(s), title(s), abbreviation(s), version
   number(s), and release number(s).


System overview
---------------

.. This paragraph shall briefly state the purpose of the system to
   which this document applies. It shall describe the general nature
   of the system; summarize the history of system development,
   operation, and maintenance; identify the project sponsor, acquirer,
   user, developer, and support agencies; identify current and planned
   operating sites; and list other relevant documents.


Document overview
-----------------

.. This paragraph shall summarize the purpose and contents of this
   document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations
   associated with its use.


Referenced documents
====================

.. This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of
   all documents referenced in this specification. This section shall
   also identify the source for all documents not available through
   normal Government stocking activities.


Requirements
============

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   specify the system requirements, that is, those characteristics of
   the system that are conditions for its acceptance. Each requirement
   shall be assigned a project-unique identifier to support testing
   and traceability and shall be stated in such a way that an
   objective test can be defined for it. Each requirement shall be
   annotated with associated qualification method(s) (see section 4)
   and, for subsystems, traceability to system requirements (see
   section 5.a), if not provided in those sections. The degree of
   detail to be provided shall be guided by the following rule:
   Include those characteristics of the system that are conditions for
   system acceptance; defer to design descriptions those
   characteristics that the acquirer is willing to leave up to the
   developer. If there are no requirements in a given paragraph, the
   paragraph shall so state. If a given requirement fits into more
   than one paragraph, it may be stated once and referenced from the
   other paragraphs.


Required states and modes
-------------------------

.. If the system is required to operate in more than one state or mode
   having requirements distinct from other states or modes, this
   paragraph shall identify and define each state and mode. Examples
   of states and modes include: idle, ready, active, post-use
   analysis, training, degraded, emergency, backup, wartime,
   peacetime. The distinction between states and modes is arbitrary. A
   system may be described in terms of states only, modes only, states
   within modes, modes within states, or any other scheme that is
   useful. If no states or modes are required, this paragraph shall so
   state, without the need to create artificial distinctions. If
   states and/or modes are required, each requirement or group of
   requirements in this specification shall be correlated to the
   states and modes. The correlation may be indicated by a table or
   other method in this paragraph, in an appendix referenced from this
   paragraph, or by annotation of the requirements in the paragraphs
   where they appear.


System capability requirements
------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall be divided into subparagraphs to itemize the
   requirements associated with each capability of the system. A
   "capability" is defined as a group of related requirements. The
   word "capability" may be replaced with "function," "subject,"
   "object," or other term useful for presenting the requirements.


(System capability)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall identify a required system capability and
   shall itemize the requirements associated with the capability. If
   the capability can be more clearly specified by dividing it into
   constituent capabilities, the constituent capabilities shall be
   specified in subparagraphs. The requirements shall specify required
   behavior of the system and shall include applicable parameters,
   such as response times, throughput times, other timing constraints,
   sequencing, accuracy, capacities (how much/how many), priorities,
   continuous operation requirements, and allowable deviations based
   on operating conditions. The requirements shall include, as
   applicable, required behavior under unexpected, unallowed, or "out
   of bounds" conditions, requirements for error handling, and any
   provisions to be incorporated into the system to provide continuity
   of operations in the event of emergencies. Paragraph 3.3.x of this
   DID provides a list of topics to be considered when specifying
   requirements regarding inputs the system must accept and outputs it
   must produce.


System external interface requirements
--------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall be divided into subparagraphs to specify the
   requirements, if any, for the system's external interfaces. This
   paragraph may reference one or more Interface Requirements
   Specifications (IRSs) or other documents containing these
   requirements.


Interface identification and diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall identify the required external interfaces of
   the system. The identification of each interface shall include a
   project-unique identifier and shall designate the interfacing
   entities (systems, configuration items, users, etc.) by name,
   number, version, and documentation references, as applicable. The
   identification shall state which entities have fixed interface
   characteristics (and therefore impose interface requirements on
   interfacing entities) and which are being developed or modified
   (thus having interface requirements imposed on them). One or more
   interface diagrams shall be provided to depict the interfaces.


(Project unique identifier of interface)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph (beginning with 3.3.2) shall identify a system
   external interface by project unique identifier, shall briefly
   identify the interfacing entities, and shall be divided into
   subparagraphs as needed to state the requirements imposed on the
   system to achieve the interface. Interface characteristics of the
   other entities involved in the interface shall be stated as
   assumptions or as "When [the entity not covered] does this, the
   system shall...," not as requirements on the other entities. This
   paragraph may reference other documents (such as data dictionaries,
   standards for communication protocols, and standards for user
   interfaces) in place of stating the information here. The
   requirements shall include the following, as applicable, presented
   in any order suited to the requirements, and shall note any
   differences in these characteristics from the point of view of the
   interfacing entities (such as different expectations about the

   out for special treatment. If all requirements have equal weight,
   this paragraph shall so state.


Qualification provisions
========================

.. This section shall define a set of qualification methods and shall
   specify for each requirement in Section 3 the method(s) to be used
   to ensure that the requirement has been met. A table may be used to
   present this information, or each requirement in Section 3 may be
   annotated with the method(s) to be used. Qualification methods may
   include:

.. Demonstration: The operation of the system, or a part of the
   system, that relies on observable functional operation not
   requiring the use of instrumentation, special test equipment, or
   subsequent analysis.
   Test: The operation of the system, or a part of the system, using
   instrumentation or other special test equipment to collect data for
   later analysis.
   Analysis: The processing of accumulated data obtained from other
   qualification methods. Examples are reduction, interpolation, or
   extrapolation of test results.
   Inspection: The visual examination of system components,
   documentation, etc.
   Special qualification methods. Any special qualification methods
   for the system, such as special tools, techniques, procedures,
   facilities, acceptance limits, use of standard samples,
   preproduction or periodic production samples, pilot models, or
   pilot lots.

Requirements traceability
=========================

.. For system-level specifications, this paragraph does not apply. For
   subsystem-level specifications, this paragraph shall contain:

.. Traceability from each subsystem requirement in this specification
   to the system requirements it addresses. (Alternatively, this
   traceability may be provided by annotating each requirement in
   Section 3.)   
   Note: Each level of system refinement may result in requirements
   not directly traceable to higher-level requirements. For example, a
   system architectural design that creates two subsystems may result
   in requirements about how the subsystems will interface, even
   though these interfaces are not covered in system requirements.
   Such requirements may be traced to a general requirement such as
   "system implementation" or to the system design decisions that
   resulted in their generation.
   Traceability from each system requirement that has been allocated
   to the subsystem covered by this specification to the subsystem
   requirements that address it. All system requirements allocated to
   the subsystem shall be accounted for. Those that trace to subsystem
   requirements contained in IRSs shall reference those IRSs.

   for convenience in document maintenance (e.g., charts, classified
   data). As applicable, each appendix shall be referenced in the main
   body of the document where the data would normally have been
   provided. Appendixes may be bound as separate documents for ease in
