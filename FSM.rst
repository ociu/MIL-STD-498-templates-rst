=================================

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.


(Identifier of programmed firmware device)
------------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall state the project-unique identifier of a
   programmed firmware device to be used in the system and shall be
   divided into the following subparagraphs.


Description of pre-programmed device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall:

.. Identify by manufacturer's name and model number the firmware
   device to be programmed
   Provide a complete physical description of the firmware device,
   including the following, as applicable:
   1.  Memory size, type, speed, and configuration (such as 64Kx1,
       8Kx8)
   2.  Operating characteristics (such as access time, power
       requirements,logic levels)
   3.  Pin functional descriptions
   4.  Logical interfaces (such as addressing scheme, chip selection)
   5.  Internal and external identification scheme used
   6.  Timing diagrams

.. Describe the operational and environmental limits to which the
   firmware device may be subjected and still maintain satisfactory
   operation

Software to be programmed into the device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall identify by project-unique identifier(s) the
   software to be programmed into the firmware device.


Programming equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall describe the equipment to be used for
   programming and reprogramming the firmware device. It shall include
   computer equipment, general purpose equipment, and special
   equipment to be used for device erasure, loading, verification, and
   marking, as applicable. Each piece of equipment shall be identified
   by manufacturer's name, model number, and any other information
   that is necessary to uniquely identify that piece of equipment. A
   description of each piece of equipment shall be provided, including
   its purpose, usage, and major capabilities.


Programming software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall describe the software to be used for
   programming and reprogramming the firmware device. It shall include
   software to be used for device erasure, loading, verification, and
   marking, as applicable. Each software item shall be identified by
   vendor's name, software name, number, version/release, and any
   other information necessary to uniquely identify the software item.
   A description of each software item shall be provided, including
   its purpose, usage, and major capabilities.


Programming procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall describe the procedures to be used for
   programming and reprogramming the firmware device. It shall include
   procedures to be used for device erasure, loading, verification,
   and marking, as applicable. All equipment and software necessary
   for each procedure shall be identified, together with any security
   and privacy measures to be applied.


Installation and repair procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall contain the installation, replacement, and
   repair procedures for the firmware device. This paragraph shall
   also include remove and replace procedures, device addressing
   scheme and implementation, description of the host board layout,
   and any procedures for ensuring continuity of operations in the
   event of emergencies. Safety precautions, marked by WARNING or
   CAUTION, shall be included where applicable.


Vendor information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This section shall include or reference any relevant information
   supplied by the vendor(s) of the firmware device, programming
   equipment, or programming software.


Notes
=====

.. This section shall contain any general information that aids in
   understanding this document (e.g., background information,
   glossary, rationale). This section shall include an alphabetical
   listing of all acronyms, abbreviations, and their meanings as used
