Programming environment
=======================

.. This section shall be divided into paragraphs as appropriate to
   provide the following information.

.. The components and configuration of the computer system
   Operating characteristics, capabilities, and limitations,
   including, as applicable:
   1.  Machine cycle time
   2.  Word length
   3.  Memory capacity and characteristics

   8.  Error indicators Input/output characteristics
   9.  Input/output characteristics
   10. Special features

.. Description of the equipment (e.g., tapes, disks, other peripheral
   equipment) necessary to perform compilations and assemblies on the
   computer system. Identify (as applicable) by name and version
   number the editor, linker, link editor, compiler, assembler, cross
   compilers, cross assemblers, and other utilities used, and
   reference appropriate manuals describing their use. Highlight any
   special flags or instructions necessary for loading, executing, or
   recording the results.

Programming information
=======================

.. This section shall be divided into paragraphs as appropriate to
   provide the following information.

.. Description of the programming features of the computer's
   instruction set architecture, including, as applicable:
   1.  Data representation (e.g., byte, word, integer, floating point,
       double precision)
   2.  Instruction formats and addressing modes
   3.  Special registers and words (e.g., stack pointer, program
       counter)
   4.  Control instructions (e.g., branch, jump, subroutine and
       procedure call instructions, privileged instructions, and the modes
       they operate in)
   5.  Subroutines and procedures (e.g., non reentrant, reentrant,
       macrocode routines, argument lists, parameter passing conventions)
   6.  Interrupt processing
   7.  Timers and clocks
   8.  Memory protection features (e.g., read only memory)
   9.  Additional features, such as instruction or data cache
       architecture

.. Description of each instruction, including, as applicable:
   1.  Use
   2.  Syntax
   3.  Condition codes set
   4.  Execution time
   5.  Machine code format
   6.  Mnemonic conventions
   7.  Other characteristics

.. Description of input and output control programming, including, as
   applicable:
   1.  Initial loading and verification of computer memory
   2.  Serial and parallel data channels
   3.  Discrete inputs and outputs
   4.  Interface components
   5.  Device numbers, operational codes, and memory locations for
       peripheral equipment

.. Additional, restricted, or special programming techniques
   associated with the computer system (e.g., a concise description of
   the microprogram control section)
   Examples that demonstrate the programming features described above,
   including examples of the proper use of all categories of
   instructions on the computer system
   Error detection and diagnostic features associated with the
   computer system, including condition codes, overflow and addressing
   exception interrupts, and input and output error status indicators

Notes
=====

.. This section shall contain any general information that aids in
   understanding this document (e.g., background information,
   glossary, rationale). This section shall include an alphabetical
   listing of all acronyms, abbreviations, and their meanings as used
   in this document and a list of terms and definitions needed to
