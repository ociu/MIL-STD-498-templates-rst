.. This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of
   all documents referenced in this document. This section shall also
   identify the source for all documents not available through normal
   Government stocking activities.


System-wide design decisions
============================

.. This section shall be divided into paragraphs as needed to present
   system-wide design decisions, that is, decisions about the system's
   behavioral design (how it will behave, from a user's point of view,
   in meeting its requirements, ignoring internal implementation) and
   other decisions affecting the selection and design of system
   components. If all such decisions are explicit in the requirements
   or are deferred to the design of the system components, this
   section shall so state. Design decisions that respond to
   requirements designated critical, such as those for safety,
   security, or privacy, shall be placed in separate subparagraphs. If
   a design decision depends upon system states or modes, this
   dependency shall be indicated. Design conventions needed to
   understand the design shall be presented or referenced. Examples of
   system-wide design decisions are the following:

.. Design decisions regarding inputs the system will accept and
   outputs it will produce, including interfaces with other systems,
   configuration items, and users (4.3.x of this DID identifies topics
   to be considered in this description). If part or all of this
   information is given in Interface Design Descriptions (IDDs), they
   may be referenced.
   Design decisions on system behavior in response to each input or
   condition, including actions the system will perform, response
   times and other performance characteristics, description of
   physical systems modeled, selected equations/algorithms/ rules, and
   handling of unallowed inputs or conditions.
   Design decisions on how system databases/data files will appear to
   the user (4.3.x of this DID identifies topics to be considered in
   this description). If part or all of this information is given in
   Database Design Descriptions (DBDDs), they may be referenced.
   Selected approach to meeting safety, security, and privacy
   requirements.
   Design and construction choices for hardware or hardware-software
   systems, such as physical size, color, shape, weight, materials,
   and markings.
   Other system-wide design decisions made in response to
   requirements, such as selected approach to providing required
   flexibility, availability, and maintainability.

System architectural design
===========================

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   describe the system architectural design. If part or all of the
   design depends upon system states or modes, this dependency shall
   be indicated. If design information falls into more than one
   paragraph, it may be presented once and referenced from the other
   paragraphs. Design conventions needed to understand the design
   shall be presented or referenced.   
   Note: For brevity, this section is written in terms of organizing a
   system directly into Hardware Configuration Items (HWCIs), Computer
   Software Configuration Items (CSCIs), and manual operations, but
   should be interpreted to cover organizing a system into subsystems,
   organizing a subsystem into HWCIs, CSCIs, and manual operations, or
   other variations as appropriate.


System components
-----------------

.. This paragraph shall:

.. Identify the components of the system (HWCIs, CSCIs, and manual
   operations). Each component shall be assigned a project-unique
   identifier. Note: a database may be treated as a CSCI or as part of
   a CSCI.
   Show the static (such as "consists of") relationship(s) of the
   components. Multiple relationships may be presented, depending on
   the selected design methodology.
   State the purpose of each component and identify the system
   requirements and system-wide design decisions allocated to it.
   (Alternatively, the allocation of requirements may be provided in
   5.a.)
   Identify each component's development status/type, if known (such
   as new development, existing component to be reused as is, existing
   design to be reused as is, existing design or component to be
   reengineered, component to be developed for reuse, component
   planned for Build N, etc.) For existing design or components, the
   description shall provide identifying information, such as name,
   version, documentation references, location, etc.
   For each computer system or other aggregate of computer hardware
   resources identified for use in the system, describe its computer
   hardware resources (such as processors, memory, input/output
   devices, auxiliary storage, and communications/ network equipment).
   Each description shall, as applicable, identify the configuration
   items that will use the resource, describe the allocation of
   resource utilization to each CSCI that will use the resource (for
   example, 20% of the resource's capacity allocated to CSCI 1, 30% to
   CSCI 2), describe the conditions under which utilization will be
   measured, and describe the characteristics of the resource:
   Descriptions of computer processors shall include, as applicable,
   manufacturer name and model number, processor speed/capacity,
   identification of instruction set architecture, applicable
   compiler(s), word size (number of bits in each computer word),
   character set standard (such as ASCII, EBCDIC), and interrupt
   capabilities.
   Descriptions of memory shall include, as applicable, manufacturer
   name and model number and memory size, type, speed, and
   configuration (such as 256K cache memory, 16MB RAM (4MB x 4)).
   Descriptions of input/output devices shall include, as applicable,
   manufacturer name and model number, type of device, and device
   speed/capacity.
   Descriptions of auxiliary storage shall include, as applicable,
   manufacturer name and model number, type of storage, amount of
   installed storage, and storage speed.
   Descriptions of communications/network equipment, such as modems,
   network interface cards, hubs, gateways, cabling, high speed data
   lines, or aggregates of these or other components, shall include,
   as applicable, manufacturer name and model number, data transfer
   rates/capacities, network topologies, transmission techniques, and
   protocols used.
   Each description shall also include, as applicable, growth
   capabilities, diagnostic capabilities, and any additional hardware
   capabilities relevant to the description.
   Present a specification tree for the system, that is, a diagram
   that identifies and shows the relationships among the planned
   specifications for the system components.

Concept of execution
--------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe the concept of execution among the
   system components. It shall include diagrams and descriptions
   showing the dynamic relationship of the components, that is, how
   they will interact during system operation, including, as
   applicable, flow of execution control, data flow, dynamically
   controlled sequencing, state transition diagrams, timing diagrams,
   priorities among components, handling of interrupts,
   timing/sequencing relationships, exception handling, concurrent
   execution, dynamic allocation/deallocation, dynamic
   creation/deletion of objects, processes, tasks, and other aspects
   of dynamic behavior.


Interface design
----------------

.. This paragraph shall be divided into the following subparagraphs to
   describe the interface characteristics of the system components. It
   shall include both interfaces among the components and their
   interfaces with external entities such as other systems,
   configuration items, and users. Note: There is no requirement for
   these interfaces to be completely designed at this level; this
   paragraph is provided to allow the recording of interface design
   decisions made as part of system architectural design. If part or
   all of this information is contained in Interface Design
   Descriptions (IDDs) or elsewhere, these sources may be referenced.


Interface identification and diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph shall state the project-unique identifier assigned
   to each interface and shall identify the interfacing entities
   (systems, configuration items, users, etc.) by name, number,
   version, and documentation references, as applicable. The
   identification shall state which entities have fixed interface
   characteristics (and therefore impose interface requirements on
   interfacing entities) and which are being developed or modified
   (thus having interface requirements imposed on them). One or more
   interface diagrams shall be provided, as appropriate, to depict the
   interfaces.


(Project unique identifier of interface)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. This paragraph (beginning with 4.3.2) shall identify an interface
   by project unique identifier, shall briefly identify the
   interfacing entities, and shall be divided into subparagraphs as
   needed to describe the interface characteristics of one or both of
   the interfacing entities. If a given interfacing entity is not
   covered by this SSDD (for example, an external system) but its
   interface characteristics need to be mentioned to describe
   interfacing entities that are, these characteristics shall be
   stated as assumptions or as "When [the entity not covered] does
   this, [the entity that is covered] will ...." This paragraph may
   reference other documents (such as data dictionaries, standards for
   protocols, and standards for user interfaces) in place of stating
   the information here. The design description shall include the
   following, as applicable, presented in any order suited to the
   information to be provided, and shall note any differences in these
   characteristics from the point of view of the interfacing entities
   (such as different expectations about the size, frequency, or other
   characteristics of data elements):
