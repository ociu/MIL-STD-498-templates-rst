.. This paragraph shall contain a full identification of the system to
   which this document applies, including, as applicable,
   identification number(s), title(s), abbreviation(s), version
   number(s), and release number(s).


System overview
---------------

.. This paragraph shall briefly state the purpose of the system to
   which this document applies. It shall describe the general nature
   of the system; summarize the history of system development,
   operation, and maintenance; identify the project sponsor, acquirer,
   user, developer, and support agencies; identify current and planned
   operating sites; and list other relevant documents.


Document overview

.. This paragraph shall summarize the purpose and contents of this
   document and shall describe any security or privacy considerations
   associated with its use.


Referenced documents
====================

.. This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date of
   all documents referenced in this document. This section shall also
   identify the source for all documents not available through normal

Current system or situation
===========================

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   describe the system or situation as it currently exists.


Background, objectives, and scope
---------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe the background, mission or
   objectives, and scope of the current system or situation.


Operational policies and constraints
------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe any operational policies and
   constraints that apply to the current system or situation.


Description of current system or situation
------------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall provide a description of the current system or
   situation, identifying differences associated with different states
   or modes of operation (for example, regular, mainte-nance,
   training, degraded, emergency, alternative-site, wartime,
   peacetime). The distinction between states and modes is arbitrary.
   A system may be described in terms of states only, modes only,
   states within modes, modes within states, or any other scheme that
   is useful. If the system operates without states or modes, this
   paragraph shall so state, without the need to create artificial
   distinctions. The description shall include, as applicable:

.. The operational environment and its characteristics
   Major system components and the interconnections among these
   components
   Interfaces to external systems or procedures
   Capabilities/functions of the current system
   Charts and accompanying descriptions depicting inputs, outputs,
   data flow, and manual and automated processes sufficient to
   understand the current system or situation from the user's point of
   view
   Performance characteristics, such as speed, throughput, volume,
   frequency
   Quality attributes, such as reliability, maintainability,
   availability, flexibility, portability, usability, efficiency
   Provisions for safety, security, privacy, and continuity of
   operations in emergencies

Users or involved personnel
---------------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe the types of users of the system, or
   personnel involved in the current situation, including, as
   applicable, organizational structures, training/skills,
   responsibilities, activities, and interactions with one another.


Support concept
---------------

.. This paragraph shall provide an overview of the support concept for
   the current system, including, as applicable to this document,
   support agency(ies); facilities; equipment; support software;
   repair/replacement criteria; maintenance levels and cycles; and
   storage, distribution, and supply methods.


Justification for and nature of changes
=======================================

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.


Justification for change
------------------------

.. This paragraph shall:

.. Describe new or modified aspects of user needs, threats, missions,
   objectives, environ-ments, interfaces, personnel or other factors
   that require a new or modified system
   Summarize deficiencies or limitations in the current system or
   situation that make it unable to respond to these factors

Description of needed changes
-----------------------------

.. This paragraph shall summarize new or modified
   capabilities/functions, processes, interfaces, or other changes
   needed to respond to the factors identified in 4.1.


Priorities among the changes
----------------------------

.. This paragraph shall identify priorities among the needed changes.
   It shall, for example, identify each change as essential,
   desirable, or optional, and prioritize the desirable and optional
   changes.


Changes considered but not included
-----------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall identify changes considered but not included
   in 4.2, and rationale for not including them.


Assumptions and constraints
---------------------------

.. This paragraph shall identify any assumptions and constraints
   applicable to the changes identi-fied in this section.


Concept for a new or modified system
====================================

.. This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
   describe a new or modified system.


Background, objectives, and scope
---------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe the background, mission or
   objectives, and scope of the new or modified system.


Operational policies and constraints
------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall describe any operational policies and
   constraints that apply to the new or modified system.


Description of the new or modified system
-----------------------------------------

.. This paragraph shall provide a description of the new or modified
   system, identifying differences associated with different states or
   modes of operation (for example, regular, maintenance, train-ing,
   degraded, emergency, alternative-site, wartime, peacetime). The
   distinction between states and modes is arbitrary. A system may be
   described in terms of states only, modes only, states within modes,
   modes within states, or any other scheme that is useful. If the
   system operates without states or modes, this paragraph shall so
   state, without the need to create artificial distinctions. The
   description shall include, as applicable:
